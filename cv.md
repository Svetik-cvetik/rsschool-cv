## Briefly about Myself
I was born in Belarus but since 2018 I've been living in Lithuania. I'm a mom of two amazing sons, Platon and Miron. My goal is to change my profession and become a Frontend JS developer. My soft skills are amiability, openness to the world, people and ideas, flexibility and a good sense of humour. I easily get on with new people, a responsible and reliable team worker.One of my strengths is the ability to solve different tasks at the same time (Thank you,kids)). I enjoy learning something new and often can lose myself in it. My hobbies are travelling and fashion.
